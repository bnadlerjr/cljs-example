# cljs-example
Example Middleman project that supports ClojureScript via `shadow-cljs`.

## Installation

### Pre-requisites:
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository and enter project directory
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `yarn install`

## Quickstart
To start the Middleman server, from the project root run `./bin/middleman`.  This will start Middleman's preview server and compile ClojureScript files to JavaScript. Any changes made to ClojureScript files will be reflected in the browser.

To build the site, run `./bin/middleman build`. This will build the static site in the `build` folder, which can then be deployed to you web server.

Refer to the [Middleman documentation](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/) for more information on the preview server, building, etc. Refer to the [shadow-cljs user guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html) for more information on how shadow-cljs works and its configuration options.
